## If you want to help me, you can update this documentation through pull request.

For start the modification, you need installed Forge, it is desirable that the version matches the supported versions. You can download Forge from the [link](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.14.4.html).
Move the downloaded mod (marked `-MOD` in the file name) to the `mods` folder (installation example below).

```
.
├── assets
├── config
├── libraries
├── mods (that's how it should be)
│   └── Project Essentials Core-MOD-1.14.4-1.X.X.X.jar
└── ...
```

Now try to start the game, go to the `mods` tab, if this modification is displayed in the `mods` tab, then the mod has been successfully installed.
