> ## Documentation for basically using CoreAPI.

## 1. For playing and running minecraft:

#### 1.1 Download Core API mod module.

Visit **Core API** repository on github, visit **releases** tab and download `.jar` files of latest _pre-release_ / release (**recommended**)

Releases page: https://github.com/ProjectEssentials/ProjectEssentials-Core/releases

#### 1.2 Install Core API modification.

The minecraft forge folder structure below will help you understand what is written below.

```
.
├── assets
├── config
├── libraries
├── mods (that's how it should be)
│   └── Project Essentials Core-MOD-1.14.4-1.X.X.X.jar
└── ...
```

Place your mods and Core API mods according to the structure above.

#### 1.3 Verifying mod on the correct installation.

Run the game, check the number of mods, if the list of mods contains `Project Essentials Core` mod, then the mod has successfully passed the initialization of the modification.

## 2. For developing and developers:

### 2.1 Getting started with installing.

To get the Core API source for development and interactions with the rights of players, you need to get the dependencies and get the documentation to view it in your IDE.

Installation documentation is located in the readme file or just follow the link: https://github.com/ProjectEssentials/ProjectEssentials-Core#-install-using-gradle
